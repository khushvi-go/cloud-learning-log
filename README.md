# cloud-learning-log

This repository documents my journey toward becoming a cloud engineer.

## Purpose
- Build strong fundamentals in cloud computing and DevOps
- Learn by doing, not by watching
- Maintain a public log of daily progress

## Commitment
- Consistent daily effort
- Focus on one path: Cloud Engineering
- Progress measured by projects, not motivation

## Progress Log
### Day 1
- Installed development tools (VS Code, Git)
- Set up GitHub workflow
- Studied core cloud concepts: server, VM, instance, EC2

This repository will be updated regularly with notes, commands, and projects.
